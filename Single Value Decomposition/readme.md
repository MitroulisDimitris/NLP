## Single Value Decomposition projects
SVD is a mathematical technique used in linear algebra to factorize a matrix into three distinct matrices. Given a matrix A, SVD decomposes it as follows:

**A = UΣV^Τ^**

Where: 

 - U is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are called the left singular vectors.

 - Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values, which are non-negative and arranged in descending order.

 - V^T^ is the transpose of an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the right singular vectors.


#### LSA using SVD.ipynb:

Summary: This project implements Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) using Singular Value Decomposition. LSA is used to identify patterns in relationships between terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text. By applying SVD, the project reduces the dimensionality of the term-document matrix, revealing latent semantic structures in the data, which are then used for tasks such as topic extraction and text summarization.


#### RecommenderSystem.ipynb:

Summary: This project utilizes Singular Value Decomposition to build a recommendation system. SVD helps in decomposing the user-item interaction matrix, capturing latent features that represent users' preferences and items' characteristics. The resulting model is used to predict user ratings for unseen items and to recommend items that the user is likely to find interesting.

#### SentimentAnalysis.ipynb:

Summary: In this project, Singular Value Decomposition is applied to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. SVD is used to reduce the dimensionality of the term-document matrix, which helps in capturing the underlying sentiment patterns in the text. The project then classifies the sentiment of the text, typically into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

#### TopicModeling.ipynb:

Summary: This project leverages Singular Value Decomposition for topic modeling. SVD is used to decompose the document-term matrix, identifying the latent topics within a collection of documents. The project helps in understanding the main themes or topics discussed across a large corpus of text.
